                    <p class="text-black mb-4">
                        As part of a Wilson contract project, I played a key role in developing an AI model designed to revolutionize the custom golf club fitting process. Working alongside engineers and data scientists, I helped build and train the model using a wide range of performance data, including swing speed, launch angle, spin rate, player height, and grip strength. My contribution involved not only gathering and organizing player data from fittings and simulations but also refining the model’s predictive accuracy by testing various machine learning algorithms. The goal was to personalize club recommendations—shaft type, lie angle, clubhead design—for individual players with precision. We integrated the model into a user-friendly platform that could be used by fitters in real-time, improving consistency and reducing guesswork in club customization. This tool empowered Wilson to deliver a more tailored experience for both amateur and professional golfers, aligning with their push for data-driven innovation. It was incredibly rewarding to contribute to a solution that blends technology with sports performance, helping players get more out of their game through scientifically backed equipment recommendations. The project highlighted the power of AI in athletics and gave me valuable experience in combining technical development with real-world application.

                    <p class="text-black mb-4">
                      I played a key role in the networking and application design for the Digital Twin Classroom project by leveraging cloud server technology to bring our prototype to life. My responsibilities included architecting the platform where the classroom’s real-time data—such as occupancy, environmental controls, and device interactions—could be monitored and simulated through a web-based application. I designed the application interface to be intuitive for both students and educators, ensuring seamless access to live data and control features. I also configured the backend networking infrastructure, using cloud platforms to host and scale our services securely and efficiently. This allowed for remote access, system updates, and reliable performance across different devices. By deploying the classroom prototype on a cloud-based system, we enabled a flexible, scalable digital environment that mirrors real-world classroom behavior. The project demonstrated the impact of smart environments in education and gave me hands-on experience integrating IoT, networking, and cloud technologies.

                    <p class="text-black mb-4">
                        UX/UI design and brand redevelopment are crucial for a nonprofit’s growth because they directly influence how the organization is perceived and engaged with. A clean, intuitive website or platform helps users easily access information, donate, or get involved—reducing barriers and boosting trust. Strong branding creates a clear, consistent identity that resonates with supporters and communicates the nonprofit’s mission effectively. Together, UX/UI and branding establish credibility, improve user experience, and build emotional connections. In a crowded digital space, standing out and making navigation effortless is key to attracting and retaining donors, volunteers, and partners who drive the organization’s long-term impact
